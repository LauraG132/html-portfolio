<hr/>

<h3>Green Mile</h3>
<p>This is hart breaking movie. Shows how cruel the world can be, but also, how the person in it stays human, no matter what.</p>
<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>Movie that will move you.</p>
<h3>Scusa ma ti chiamo amore</h3>
<p>Italian movie, as I love Italian language as I lived in Italy for a while. Reminds me of Italian culture and the language as such. Makes me smile.</p>
